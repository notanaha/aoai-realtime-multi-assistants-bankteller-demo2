Welcome. My name is Yamada, and I'll be assisting you today.

**[Customer 00:08]**
Thank you. I got married and moved last month, so I'm here to update my information.

**[Bank Teller 00:17]**
Congratulations. So, it's an address change. Have you also changed your phone number? And with your marriage, will there be a change in the account holder's name as well?

**[Customer 00:29]**
I believe my mobile number is registered, and that hasn't changed. But I'd like to update the name on the account.

**[Bank Teller 00:36]**
Understood. Since the name will be changed, we will also reissue your cash card. Could you please provide your bank account number?

**[Customer 00:47]**
Yes. The account number is 231-1555.

**[Bank Teller 00:54]**
Thank you. Now, please provide your new name and address.

**[Customer 01:03]**
My new name is Hanako Foundry, and my new address is 1-1-1 Konan, Minato-ku, Tokyo.

**[Bank Teller 01:14]**
Thank you. For confirmation, please show your ID such as your driver's license or health insurance card with your new name.

**[Customer 01:27]**
Sure. Here it is.

**[Bank Teller 01:33]**
Thank you. We've confirmed it using your driver's license. Will there be any changes to the type of card or your PIN?

**[Customer 01:43]**
No, those will stay the same.

**[Bank Teller 01:50]**
Understood. Please submit the form for the changes. Review the details, and if everything is correct, please press the confirm button.

**[Customer 02:12]**
Yes, it's correct. I've pressed it.

**[Bank Teller 02:17]**
Great. Your request has been successfully submitted. That concludes today's procedures. Please make sure you haven't left anything behind. Thank you very much.
